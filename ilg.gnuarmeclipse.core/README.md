This plug-in provides no functionality.

It is used as a workaround to remove old GNU ARM Eclipse pre v4.x, by having a
version higher then any used versions, and triggering a plug-in uninstall
of all plug-ins that depend on it.

It is added as a dependency to ilg.gnumcueclipse.managedbuild.cross.arm.
