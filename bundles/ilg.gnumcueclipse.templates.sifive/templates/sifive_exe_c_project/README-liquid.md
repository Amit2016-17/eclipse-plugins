# {{ boardDescription }} '{{ content }}' project

This project was generated by the GNU MCU Eclipse SiFive template.

## Application specific files

The application specific files are in the `src`, `include` and `ldscripts` folders. Edit them to implement the desired application functionality.

## Framework common files

The _system_ files, common to many applications, are grouped in the `system` folder.

Most of the files are part of the [µOS++](http://micro-os-plus.github.io) project.

### Portable files

- `diag` - diagnostic trace functions
- `libc` - functions to complement the C library
- `libcpp` -  functions to complement the C++ functions
- `startup` - portable startup

### Architecture/device/board files

- `system/riscv-arch` RISC-V architecture files
- `system/sifive-coreplex-devices` SiFive Coreplex IP devices files
- `system/sifive-hifive1-board` SiFive Freedom E310 HiFive1 files
- `system/coreplex-arty-boards` SiFive Coreplex IP Arty FPGA files

## Debug

An OpenOCD debug launch file is automatically generated.

{% if board == 'hifive1' %}
The HiFive1 board has an on board JTAG programmer. The OpenOCD configuration 
is available as a single file `-f "board/sifive-freedom-e300-hifive1.cfg"`.

{% elsif board == 'e31arty' or board == 'e51arty' %}
The Arty board has a JTAG hardware connection, and uses an external JTAG probe.
The debug session is configured to use the JTAG probe 
Olimex ARM-USB-TINY-H. For other probes, edit the launch configuration and
change the `-f "interface/ftdi/olimex-arm-usb-tiny-h.cfg"`, for example, for
Olimex ARM-USB-OCD, use `-f "interface/ftdi/olimex-arm-usb-ocd.cfg"`.

To see the complete list of probes supported, go to the
OpenOCD binaries, the `scripts/interface` OpenOCD folder.

The referred files are available in the GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD distribution. 
If you use other distributions, you can get the files from [GitHub](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/tree/gnu-mcu-eclipse-dev/tcl/board); download the `sifive-*.cfg` files and 
copy them in the `scripts/interface` OpenOCD folder.
