### Important notice

SourceForce recently updated the security certificates, making Eclipse install/upgrades fail with messages like this:

```
No repository found at http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.sourceforge.io/v4-neon-updates
```

or 

```
!MESSAGE Unable to read repository at http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.sourceforge.io/v4-neon-updates-test/content.xml.
!STACK 0
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure
```

The solution is to upgrade JDK to a version higher than 8u101 and possibly install the Java Cryptographic Extensions.

For more details see [GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins sun.security.validator.ValidatorException](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/blog/2016/12/02/plugins-install-issue/) and [GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/blog/2017/01/29/plugins-install-issue/).

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use cases, if you have custom 
configurations, and generally if you have any experience that you want to share with others,
